Since converting to Snow Leopard when Windows 7 was released my biggest discombobulation has been modifying @PATH@ and other environment variables like @M2_HOME@. There are literally a dozen "standard tacks":standardtacks to execute this onus none of which afford chic Cocoa GUI. 

Popular techniques include:
* @~/.profile@
* @~/.bash_profile@
* @~/.bashrc@ (also @~/.{SHELL}rc@ %{text-transform:lowercase}EG(exempli gratia)% @tcsh@)
* @~/.launchd.conf@
* @~/.MacOSX/environment.plist@
* @/etc/profile@ (system variant)
* @/etc/bashrc@ (shell dependent system variant)
* @/etc/launchd.conf@ (requires reboot)
* @/etc/paths@
* @/etc/paths.d/.*@

AFAIK(as far as I know) only @/etc/launchd.conf@ works consistently between both Terminal sessions and GUI applications like "Maven in IntelliJ":intellijmaven. It delegates to "@launchctl@":launchctl subcommands "reminiscent of C shell":launchdsyntax:

{% highlight csh %}
setenv PATH /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
setenv M2_HOME /usr/share/maven # Included with XCode.
{% endhighlight %}
